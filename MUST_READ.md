Basically, I'm learning c/c++ (but mainly c) 
and yeah I'm still quite a noob, 
if you see something wrong with the way I write code then contact me at discord.

If you know how to use termux, 
please contact me. I don't know how to use it. 
Every time I post, I have to go to the website. It's quite inconvenient, right?

Note: some problems I took from sololearn(google play), leetcode, APAS(google play),......
